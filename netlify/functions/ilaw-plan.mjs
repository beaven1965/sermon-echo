// Assessing Learning, Ways Forward). It DRAFTS a plan from the teacher's own input; the teacher
// reviews and adapts it. DO 016 does not allow fully AI-generated lesson plans and asks that AI
// help be declared, so the printout carries an "AI-assisted, reviewed by the teacher" line.
// Each part is tagged to the PPST classroom-observation indicators the teacher selects, with what
// Level 7 (Outstanding for Proficient teachers) looks like — plus an observation-day checklist.
// Also works for corporate training and meetings (a session plan, without DepEd/COT parts).
// Counts as 1 of the device's free AI uses (same pool as free-ai.mjs).
// Needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY as a Netlify environment variable.

Write for the MATATAG curriculum where it applies (for College, use course outcomes instead). Use simple, clear English.
INTENTIONS: content standard, performance standard and the learning competency (use the teacher's wording or the closest MATATAG competency; do not invent a code). Then 3 SMART objectives with measurable action verbs — one each for Knowledge, Skills and Attitude/Values.
LEARNING EXPERIENCE: resources (low-cost, available in public schools; ICT optional), then a developmentally sequenced flow whose minutes add up to exactly ${f.minutes} minutes: activating prior knowledge, motivation, explicit teaching with examples, guided practice in groups (hands-on/exploration), independent practice, generalization, application to real life. For each step write what the teacher does and what learners do, a differentiation note when useful, and which indicator numbers it shows. Add integration across subjects and a values connection.
ASSESSING LEARNING: formative checks throughout (when + how, e.g. thumbs up, mini whiteboards, exit ticket), an exit task and a short rubric.
WAYS FORWARD: reteach, remediation, enrichment, and 3 reflection questions for the teacher.
COT: for EACH of these indicators the teacher's school observes, say exactly where in the plan it is shown and what the observer should see at Level 7:
${indList || '- (none selected)'}
CHECKLIST: 8–10 short reminders for observation day (before, during, after), e.g. post the objectives, prepare differentiated materials, call on all learners fairly, give specific feedback.
Be realistic: no plan can guarantee a rating — the observer rates the actual teaching. Fill in the ilaw_plan tool.`;
